Portfolio Project -
Main task was to create a portfolio website with html, css, scss, and use B.E.M as a naming convention. 
The website should be responsible to different screen sizes, such as an iPhone, an Ipad, or a Macbook. 
I have used the required technologies, and also Figma for the prototype, you can access the wireframe of the website using the links below.
